      <description>Abstract To address the challenge of segmenting noisy images with blurred or fragmented boundaries, this paper presents a robust version of Variational Model Based Tailored UNet (VM_TUNet), a hybrid framework that integrates variational methods with deep learning. The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>Abstract Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning.</description>
