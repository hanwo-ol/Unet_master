      <description>Abstract To address the challenge of segmenting noisy images with blurred or fragmented boundaries, this paper presents a robust version of Variational Model Based Tailored UNet (VM_TUNet), a hybrid framework that integrates variational methods with deep learning. The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks.</description>

      <description>Abstract Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in automated diagnostic and treatment planning systems. In this work, we present DAUNet, a novel lightweight UNet variant that integrates Deformable V2 Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention (SimAM) to improve spatial adaptability and context-aware feature fusion without increasing model complexity. DAUNet&amp;rsquo;s bottleneck employs dynamic deformable kernels to handle geometric variations, while the decoder and skip pathways are enhanced using SimAM attention modules for saliency-aware refinement.</description>

      <description>Abstract Unet and its variations have been standard in semantic image segmentation, especially for computer assisted radiology. Current Unet architectures iteratively downsample spatial resolution while increasing channel dimensions to preserve information content. Such a structure demands a large memory footprint, limiting training batch sizes and increasing inference latency. Channel pruning compresses Unet architecture without accuracy loss, but requires lengthy optimization and may not generalize across tasks and datasets. By investigating Unet pruning, we hypothesize that the final structure is the crucial factor, not the channel selection strategy of pruning.</description>

      <title>Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>

      <description>Abstract Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.</description>

      <description>Abstract We present a transfer-learning generative downscaling framework to reconstruct fine resolution satellite images from coarse scale inputs. Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA&amp;rsquo;s MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km).</description>
