      <description>Abstract Accurate post-disaster damage assessment is of high importance for prioritizing emergency response; however, manual interpretation of satellite imagery is slow, subjective, and hard to scale. While deep-learning models for image segmentation, such as U-Net-based baselines and change-detection models, are useful baselines, they often struggle with subtle structural variations and severe class imbalance, yielding poor detection of highly damaged regions. The present work proposes a deep-learning framework that jointly processes pre- and post-disaster satellite images to obtain fine-grained pixel-level damage maps: Satellite-to-Street: Disaster Impact Estimator.</description>
